## Summarize WordPress Blog

This is a Python app to extract all the **WordPress** blog posts of an author in a single page.

The idea came out of necessity when I was reading a blog and I wanted to explore other blog post by the same author. But, there was no easy way to explore all the articles. Few bloggers show 3 blogs in a page and you have to click on next page in order to read or explore the blog further. This makes it really hard to skim to through the content.

This app provides 2 input fields one for url of the blog and second for the number of pages you want to retrieve.

Working version of this app is hosted
